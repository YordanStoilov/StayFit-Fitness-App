# StayFit-Flask-App

This is my app for Fitness and Workouts, which is my CS50 Final Project. You are required to register and then log in. When you do, you can check your vitals by inputting the necessary data. This data will then be saved to your Profile and overwritten as you check again. You can search for exercises, thanks to the APINinja exercises API and save them to favourites. You can also enjoy Spotify workout playlists, which I also added using an API.
